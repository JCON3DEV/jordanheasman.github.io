# Jordan Heasman — Documentation Systems Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains a deliberately constrained representation of my work as a senior technical writer operating at the platform level.

The site is designed to support evaluation by platform and engineering leadership assessing documentation risk, governance capability, and system-level judgment. It is not a comprehensive archive of output, a résumé substitute, or a content showcase.

The primary question this site is meant to answer is:

> Can this person be trusted to own documentation for complex B2B data or security platforms where mistakes have real consequences?

## Audience

This site is built for:

- Heads of Platform
- Engineering leadership
- Senior individual contributors involved in platform design and governance

It is intentionally not optimized for:

- Recruiter keyword scanning
- Content volume comparison
- Writing speed or throughput evaluation

## Canonical Site Structure

The site has four stable surfaces:

- `/index.html` — Positioning and problem framing  
- `/work/` — System-level case studies  
- `/tags/` — Constrained semantic taxonomy  
- `/background` — Compressed verification (experience and credentials)

The homepage functions as a filter, not a table of contents.  
Case studies are the primary proof surface.

## How to Read This Site

- **Overview** establishes the problem class and operating stance.
- **Work** demonstrates judgment through constraints, decisions, and impact.
- **Tags** classify content by platform concern, not skills.
- **Background** exists for verification only and is intentionally compressed.

## Scope and Non-Goals

This repository is intentionally not designed to demonstrate:

- Publishing cadence or recency
- Breadth of writing samples
- Tutorial-style or instructional documentation
- Tool demonstrations or workflow walkthroughs
- Freelance or lead-generation work

These are deliberate scope boundaries, not omissions.

## Invariants

The following constraints are enforced:

- **Taxonomy is fixed.**  
  Tags represent platform problem classes and remain intentionally limited.

- **Case studies reflect ownership.**  
  Each case study documents the problem space, constraints, decisions, and resulting impact.

- **AI is used for enforcement, not authorship.**  
  Automation supports detection, validation, and consistency checks. Final semantic decisions remain human-owned.

- **Structure over volume.**  
  Signal density is prioritized over breadth. Low-signal content does not ship.
